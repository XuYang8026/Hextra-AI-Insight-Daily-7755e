# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. By simply accessing or using the Site, you're pretty much saying, "Yep, I agree to these terms!"

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and vibrant community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is exclusively for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account.
*   **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with all fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** are processed through trusted third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, the Site itself never stores your payment info.
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Easy peasy.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally satisfied with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up, each user gets only one shot at this refund. For subscriptions past 14 days or if you're not a first-timer, **no refunds will be issued** after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** copyright **belongs to the Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our authorization is a big no-no.
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right of access** for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright? 😉
*   **For commercial use or extensive quotation**, please contact the Site to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Users** **must not** upload, publish, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Play nice!
*   **Users** **must not** use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content. Seriously, don't try to cheat the system.
*   **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. You've been warned! 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruption
*   **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate some or all services at any time, without prior notice. Things change, you know?
*   **The Site** **will not be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to things like force majeure, server failure, or third-party service interruption. Sometimes stuff just happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information provided by the Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). We're not your lawyer, doctor, or financial advisor!
*   **The Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using the Site's content or services. Use your best judgment!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   **For any disputes** arising out of or related to these terms, both parties shall first attempt to resolve them through friendly negotiation. If negotiation fails, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
