### Product & Feature Updates

1. **Musk's Colossus 2 Supercomputer Officially Operational.**
Musk's Colossus 2 Supercomputer is officially up and running! This "city-level" computing factory in Memphis, the world's first GW-scale supercomputing cluster, packs a whopping **1GW** of power – that's like a nuclear power plant! Musk let slip that it'll hit **1.5GW** by April, eventually targeting 2GW. A [Full Report (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/01/370077.html) spilled the beans: all that power is for Grok training, paving the way for the rumored 6-trillion-parameter Grok 5. Mind blown! 🤯

2. **VerseCrafter Achieves Precise 4D Control.**
VerseCrafter achieves precise 4D control! Fudan University, teaming up with Tencent ARC Lab, just dropped the [VerseCrafter Video World Model (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05138). This bad boy can precisely control camera movements AND multiple object 3D trajectories all at once. It uses **3D Gaussian Trajectories** to encode motion, combined with a frozen Wan2.1 backbone network, delivering seriously SOTA results. The crew also cooked up a massive **VerseControl4D dataset** with **35,000** training clips. Talk about a breakthrough! ✨

### Cutting-Edge Research

1. **Sequoia Partners Declare AGI Is Here.**
Sequoia Partners Pat Grady and Sonya Huang declare AGI is here! In an article, they just dropped a bombshell, defining AGI as "the ability to figure things out." And guess what? [Long-Cycle Agents (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651012406&idx=2&sn=856648e81ca3feb14cc5077d6a9accc3) already have this superpower! They even gave an example: an agent totally aced an entire hiring process in a mere **31 minutes**. If capabilities keep doubling every 7 months, they're predicting agents could crank out an expert's full day of work by **2028**. Wild! 🤯

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1. **Google Engineer Raises 5 Harsh Questions.**
Google Engineer Addy Osmani throws down 5 brutal questions in an article diving into the [Future of Software Engineering (AI News)](https://addyosmani.com/blog/next-two-years/). Harvard research reveals a grim truth: **junior developer employment plunged by 9%** after companies jumped on generative AI. Big tech's fresh grad hiring has even been cut in half over three years. Osmani's advice? Junior devs gotta prove "themselves + AI" can go head-to-head with a small team, while senior devs need to level up as system orchestrators. Food for thought! 🤔

2. **US Residents May Face Blackouts Due to Data Centers.**
US residents might be facing blackouts, all thanks to data centers! The [Wall Street Journal (AI News)](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/power-grid-ai-data-centers-1235f296) reports that grid operator PJM is predicting rolling power outages this summer. Why? Data center demand is skyrocketing by **4.8%** annually, and new power plants just can't keep pace. Big players like Amazon and Google are fuming, slamming proposed power restrictions as "discriminatory." Meanwhile, xAI is already ahead of the game, having deployed **168** Tesla Megapacks to buffer its own power draw. Yikes! ⚡
