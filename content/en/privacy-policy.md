-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets collected automatically when you use the Service. 🤖

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (that's your IP address, for example), browser type, browser version, the pages you check out on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hang out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you hit up the Service via a mobile device, we might automatically grab certain info, like (but not limited to!) the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also collect info your browser sends when you visit our Service or access it on your mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies & Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. These tracking tech tools include beacons, tags, and scripts – they're all about collecting and tracking data to help us improve and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include: 👇

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: Think of a Cookie as a tiny file chilling on your device. You're totally in charge: you can tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. Heads up, though – if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say 'no thanks' to Cookies, our Service will likely use them. 🍪
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and they're used for other cool website stats, like seeing how popular a certain section is or double-checking our system and server integrity. ✨

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Think of it this way: Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, but Session Cookies get wiped out as soon as you close your web browser. Poof! 👻

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons: 👇

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for getting you the services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help verify who's who and stop any sneaky fraudulent use of user accounts. Honestly, without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't happen, and we only use them to make sure you get those services. 🔒

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies simply tell us if you've given the green light to use cookies on the Website. ✅

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These clever Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website – like keeping your login info handy or remembering your language preference. The whole point is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to punch in your preferences every single time you visit. Super convenient! ✨

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's truly needed for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our legal obligations (like if we have to hold onto your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. Basically, we don't hoard your stuff! 😉

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is generally kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obliged to keep it for longer. 📊

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (including your Personal Data) is processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the folks involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get transferred to and kept on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might be different from yours. Just a heads-up! 🌍

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and then submitting your info, you're essentially giving a thumbs-up to that transfer. 👍

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information. Safety first! 🛡️

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to help you scrub any Personal Data we've collected about you. Your data, your rules! 🤝

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself directly from within the Service. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by just logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings where you can manage your personal information. Or, you can hit us up to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us. We're here to help! 💬

Just a heads-up though: we might need to hold onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a lawful reason to do so. Some things just have to stick around! 🤷‍♀️

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. Don't worry, though, we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Forewarned is forearmed! 💼

#### Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request. We gotta play by the rules! 👮

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might dish out your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇

-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us! 💪 But hey, remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage method is ever 100% secure. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security. Just keeping it real! 💯

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13 years old. Period. We don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from anyone under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll totally wipe that info from our servers. Kid privacy is no joke! 🚫👶

If we ever need to rely on consent as a legal reason to process your info, and your country requires a parent's OK, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Better safe than sorry! 👩‍👧‍👦

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. Just so you know! If you click on a third-party link, you'll get rerouted to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🔗

We have zero control over and take no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. You've been warned! 🚫

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Keep an eye out! 🔄

Before any changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a clear notice on our Service. Plus, we'll update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises! 📧🔔
